## Digital Talking Thermometer
##### Reading the temperature with liquid type of thermometer is relatively tough than digital thermometer and it is more tough for disabled people. Designing a thermometer which can solve the problem of reading body temperature for both old age and disabled people. 
##### The purpose of this kind of thermometer is to make reading the temperature easier for the disabled and old aged people. This thermometer will be safer than other liquid thermometers containing mercury liquid and will show more accurate readings than them. Along with the main goal, the thermometer must also be user friendly, hence having a good grip to hold while the temperature is being detected, and must also sense the correct body temperature. Although there are plenty types of digital thermometers available in the market, but for our user it may be difficult to read the temperature from the display, hence saying it out loud will make it easier for the user to know the temperature. It must also be cost efficient and less power consuming.
